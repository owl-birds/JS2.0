// PARAMETERs ; callbacks
// callback
// The function to call when it's time to update your
// animation for the next repaint.This callback
// function is passed a single argument: a
// DOMHighResTimeStamp indicating the end time of
// the previous frame's rendering (based on the
// number of milliseconds since time origin).
// The timestamp is a decimal number, in
// milliseconds, but with a minimal precision of 1
// millisecond.For Window objects(not Workers), it
// is equal to document.timeline.currentTime.This
// timestamp is shared between all windows that run
// on the same agent(that is, all same - origin
// windows, and more importantly same - origin
// iframes) â€” which allows synchronizing animations
// across multiple requestAnimationFrame callbacks.
// The timestamp value is also similar to calling
// performance.now() at the start of the callback
// function, but it is never the same value.
// When multiple callbacks queued by
// requestAnimationFrame() begin to fire in a single
// frame, each receives the same timestamp even
// though time has passed during the computation of
// every previous callback's workload.
